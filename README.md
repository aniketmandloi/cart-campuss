# cart-campuss

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

Catalogue records live in PostgreSQL. Apply the reviewed migrations, then optionally load the labelled synthetic fixture for a private preview. Public pages read the current reviewed publishing projection and exclude that fixture unless `CATALOGUE_ALLOW_FIXTURES=true`.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm db:migrate
```

Put `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/server/.env`. The web app has its own server-only `DATABASE_URL` and renders an unconfigured catalogue when it is empty. Do not use `db:push` for these tables. Operator publishing and the visitor catalogue are in [docs/publishing-setup.md](docs/publishing-setup.md). Fixture preview checks are in [docs/catalogue-search.md](docs/catalogue-search.md).

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
From `apps/native`, run the `ios` script for iOS or the `android` script for Android to build and launch the app. See [Expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) for device setup.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@cart-campuss/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `pnpm run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Vercel Services

- Target: web + server
- Config: `vercel.json`
- Link the project first: pnpm run deploy:setup
- Local Vercel dev: pnpm run dev:vercel
- Sync preview env: pnpm run env:preview
- Sync production env: pnpm run env:production
- Dry-run check (no upload): pnpm run deploy:check
- Preview deploy: pnpm run deploy
- Production deploy: pnpm run deploy:prod
- Web requests under `/api/*` route to the server service, which serves those paths directly. Local server URLs include `/api` too.
  Vercel Services share project environment variables, but deploys do not upload local `.env` files automatically. Link the project with `vercel link`, then run the env sync command before your first deploy (otherwise the deployment starts with no env vars), or pass one-off envs with `vercel deploy -e KEY=value`.
  Pass Vercel CLI flags to the env sync command directly, for example: `pnpm run env:production --scope your-team`.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying to Vercel](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/vercel).

- `pnpm run build`: Build all applications
- `pnpm run dev:web`: Start only the web application
- `pnpm run dev:server`: Start only the server
- `pnpm run check-types`: Check TypeScript types across all apps
- `pnpm run static-analysis`: Run those TypeScript checks and print their scope. Not a linter
- `pnpm run format:check`: Check tracked text for LF, a final newline, and no trailing whitespace
